NOTICE: This PROJECT has been RELOCATED to a Repository on Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/jobmanager_hp/job-manager


The Issues Archives will be maintained for historical reference through 2015. ALL issues posted here have been thoroughly reviewed and culled for duplication's and other submission errors. The cleaned up base has been uploaded to the Bitbucket repository. In doing this we LOST REPORTERS for issues. We found that Bitbucket and GitHub do not have a method to directly import issues from Google Code.

GH would have emailed everyone with hundreds of spam emails for every submission and BB list all imported REPORTERS as Anonymous unless you allready had an established email with BitBucket.  We went with BitBucket as it was the most acceptable.

If you posted an issue here in the PAST,that ISSUE number has transferred over to BitBucket.  I would encourage you to do a search for that issue # number and comment with your email address if you want to be added back to the ISSUES list.

You can use your Google Account to Sign-Up for a Free Bitbucket account - https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/   that is the only way you can comment on issues going forward. WE WILL NOT RESPOND to any ISSUES POSTED on this GOOGLE CODE tracker.

I apologize for the inconvenience, but it was a royal pain to make this move and neither option presented was perfect.  We are still updating (have about 5 pages to go as of this writing Jan, 29, 2015) to have the entire issues updated and sorted out on Bibucket  - Thanks for your Understanding ...
